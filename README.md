Sabe: Sequence Assembly By Euler tours
======================================

By Philip M. Hubbard, 2013


Overview
--------

Sabe is a Java library that implements genome sequence assembly from short "reads" using Euler tours of De Bruijn graphs.  The library has code for a sequential implementation, and also the beginning of a parallel implementation using a map-reduce approach with Hadoop.
